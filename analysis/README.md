# Analysis files

Jupyter Notebooks and related analysis are stored here.

In the `energetics_and_finetuning` folder, much of the code and data in the `bcl2_benchmark` folder are taken and adapted from Frappier et al. (2019), and computed results in the `computed_data`, `etab_bench`, and `Figures` folder are from the original analysis done with dTERMen. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212619300085
