use psuedo-likelihood head for native sequence recovery
have an option to dump potts model per sequence
log + linear to energies head to test self-energies
give each residue a chain index

some residues have no coordinates (esp in the middle of the chain): just ignore those residue
- this means you need to modify your nan-removing code / think of a new way to deal with that
write documentation
